# Heart_Disease_Prediction

Introduction:

"Heart disease, also referred as cardiovascular diseases, is broad term used for diseases and conditions affecting the heart and circulatory system. It is a major cause of disability all around the world. Since heart is amongst the most vital organs of the body, its diseases affect other organs and part of the body as well. There are several different types and forms of heart diseases. The most common ones cause narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, malfunctioning in the valves of the heart, enlargement in the size of heart and several others leading to heart failure and heart attack."

At the start of this notebook, we laid out what we wanted to do with this project; to explore the heart disease dataset (EDA) and practice binary classification (modeling). In part one (EDA) we did explore the dataset, did a sanity check and removed some 'faulty' data and other pre-processing. We also tried to identify correlation between features and also with the target variable.
